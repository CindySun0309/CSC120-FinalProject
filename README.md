# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 we didn't really divide our works in writing the code but instead worked together. This is because when working independently, a bug will drive us crazy. We like to have someone else staying aside while we ran into a bug. Most of the time we go to Ford during the student hours. The tutors Asher and Allison helped us a lot while doing the assignment.

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
We learned how to write a whole program by ourselves (for previous assignments, we have requirements and hints given by Jordan, so we did not really think about how the whole object-oriented program works). This time, we also learned how to make our program interactive. Before doing this program, we only knew how to test programs in the main(). This time, the user can input things in the terminal. The user no longer need to be someone who knows how to code, everyone can play with our game. We also learned how to use the debug function in VSCode.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
I wish we could put the SELL method completely in the Player class instead of the StartGame class. So that the StartGame class only needs to call the sell() function from the Player class.

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
We would add more available commands such as feeding the animal, buying fodders from the farm, and randomly generalize animals into the forest, river, and the grassland. Also, we might want to incorprate the concept of time in our game, so that certain animals will only come out in days/nights.

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
The tutor Asher suggested and taught us how to use the debug function in VSCode. She suggested us to go check the output line by line instead just staring at the Error message and don't know what to do.

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
We would suggest ourselves to start the game earlier, and write simple codes at first rather than writing all classes out all at once. (Like the "building a car" picture showed to us in class in the beginning of this semester.)

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
Yes, we are friends and we did work in a team. We are both flexible on our working time and are able to reach to each other when needed. We had a good experience working with each other. As we said above, sometimes it will be really helpful to just have someone besides you when you struggled. Teamwork is great.
